When making changes to portfolio site, make sure to work and commit changes from the "source" branch. 

When ready to re-deploy: type 'npm run deploy' into the terminal, this will hopefully work to re-deploy. 
Do not work from master branch, anything work that is done on master will be overridden during deploy
